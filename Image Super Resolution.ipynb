    "# Using The Super Resolution Convolutional Neural Network for Image Restoration\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of super-resolution (SR) is to recover a high resolution image(enhance the image) from a low resolution input.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this goal, we will deploy the super-resolution convolution neural network (SRCNN) using Keras. This network was published in the paper, \"Image Super-Resolution Using Deep Convolutional Networks\" by Chao Dong, et al. in 2014.  https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00092.\n",
    "\n",
    " the SRCNN is a deep convolutional neural network that learns end-to-end mapping of low resolution to high resolution images. As a result, we can use it to improve the image quality of low resolution images. To evaluate the performance of this network, we will be using three image quality metrics: peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), mean squared error (MSE), and the structural similarity (SSIM) index."
